# Connect 4

### Play

On GitHub Pages at [https://kr-matthews.github.io/connect-4](https://kr-matthews.github.io/connect-4) -- but is still a work in progress, so link may not be live yet.

### Focus

Better use of (custom) hooks, less prop drilling, and better component management/organization.

### Planned Features

Users enter into lobby, from which they can create or join a room.
Users can change name/piece colour/light-vs-dark theme/etc. at any point, and these are remembered via local storage.
Rooms can hold up to two users at once.
Games can be played in rooms with two users.
Game-play proceeds with standard connect 4 rules on a 6 (rows) x 7 (columns) board -- possibly with the option to select a custom board size.
Wins/draws/loses are tracked until a player leaves the room.

Possibly a computer player, or several.
Possibly with animation of pieces dropping into columns.
Possibly with sounds to signal when other users join a room or play a piece.

### Backup Plan

If I can't get a live connection figured out, then it'll just be a regular connect 4 page for 2 players on a single screen. Or possibly mock a live connection by splitting the screen down the middle?

### Issues and Flaws

None so far.
